Our story started when I was born with long skinny legs, gangly arms, and an average build in the chest and shoulders… I’m pretty fit now, about 5’ 11” and 180 pounds, and from the age of 10 on when I started buying my own clothes, no offense mom, I just couldn’t take it anymore, I’ve begun to have the problem of fit.

If you get a good shirt, collar fits, sleeves and length is good, it inevitably looks like a moomoo around the chest. If I get something that fits my waist and chest, it ends up as high waters around the wrists and hips. It was always a battle.
One day, knowing there had to be a better way, I shopped online for a custom shirt option. After puking multiple times before getting through the checkout process with anyone, I finally found a custom shirt website with a special: 24.95 for everything, you design every detail, they make your perfect shirt.

Well, I placed the order, and that’s when I found out the shipping was $13.00 and the delivery would be in 6 weeks. So 37.95, and 6 weeks later I get my shirt from Thailand or someplace like that. The fit is pretty great, the look is almost exactly what I wanted, few details are off, and the fabric is pretty heavy, but I like it, so I wait for another sale, and order another one, plain white.

5 shirts and a couple fitting adjustments later, as well as branching out of the sales area to the $50-60 category, I have completely changed my outlook on what makes a fitted shirt. I completely stop purchasing shirts from retail stores because when I bring them home they feel like I’m wearing a tent. I was happy with the product that I got, the shirts were nice, but the price was a little high, and it was hard to choose a fabric from a picture, you just never know what you’re going to get.

But I had an idea, what if I got my step mom Sandra, an expert seamstress, to tailor a few of my old shirts to match the fit of my custom shirts? And on that day was born the idea that sparked CustomCutShirts.
When I got the shirts back from Sandra, they were hugely improved, and quickly became some of my favorite shirts. As Sandra became busy with her sewing shop, and no longer had time for freebie projects like step sons and their picky feelings about shirts, I started searching for another way to get my shirts tailored. I was able to come by a really old set of sewing machines and after creating a pattern from one of my previously fitted shirts, I took one of my least favorite baggy old tents and tailored it myself… it worked great! So I did a few more.

Once I was confident enough in my sewing abilities (and eliminated all un-fit shirts from my closet) I started buying new shirts that fit my neck, sleeve length, and overall length, and tailoring them for myself, saving money, and wearing nicer looking shirts than anybody else around.

As I was going through the process, I was continually trying to talk my brother Kevin into trying it, he has the basically the same build as me, and I knew he would love the results.

Finally, I talked Kevin into bringing over one of his old shirts, telling him if he just tried wearing one well tailored shirt, he wouldn’t be able to go back. Sure enough, I fitted a shirt just how he liked them, and it changed his viewpoint, he could no longer look at his previously “fitted” shirts the same, and thus was born the idea that once you’ve worn a well tailored shirt, you just can’t go back.

So we tested it on a few friends, and pretty quick they were asking us if we would fit the rest of their shirts. We knew we were onto something and that’s when Kevin used his web design skills to create this site, to see If there were other people out there like us: wanting to look great in a dress shirt, struggling with too short of sleeves or too baggy of chest and waist. Having the shirt balloon out when you tucked it in or choke you to death when you have to wear a tie.

So our offer is simple, send us a shirt with a few easy measurements, we’ll turn it into the best fitting shirt you own, and if you like it, you can send us a few more.
Regards, William
