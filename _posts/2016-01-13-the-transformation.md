So... I bought a new "SLIM FITTED" shirt from Kohls the other day. Problem is, It fits like crap! I like the fabric, the collar is comfortable and the sleeve length is right but...

(Insert Horror Movie sounds) Look at this baggy sleeve, just look at it!

I wouldn't be surprised if I could fit a whole other person in here.

32" Hips, 28" Waist, 42" Chest and 24" biceps... It's looking better already.

This will help me create a nice clean finish later on.

####3. Overlock
Now for the fun part, trim the excess and overlock the seams. (No photo here, I can't sew and run a camera at the same time)

####4. Sew
Use matching thread for the final pass on the sewing machine.

####5. The Little Details

Fix the cuff seam and hemline so it looks like no one was ever here. (Glad I picked those seams earlier)

####6. Ironing

####And the final results are in...
