We believe in the 80/20 rule… 80% of your results come from 20% of your efforts. This holds true for your personal style, as well as anything else.

Which is why we've decided to embark on a quest to hunt down and document the things that help regular guys (like you and I) look great with as little effort as humanly possible. 

>“We’re NOT lazy… We're busy and you are too, so we’ll to keep things short, simple & to the point.”

If you care about the way you look but have more important things to do than primping, shopping and/or watching fashion shows… Welcome brother! You’ve come to the right place.

On the other hand...

If you love spending hours talking about the new cloths you just bought or the outfit you wore the other day… Please leave now. The door is that way.

>“We care about looking good NOT fashion trends or what anybody else thinks we should be wearing.”

So, If you're interested in learning about simple things you can do to keep looking sharp...
