First, when we receive a shirt, our tailors analyze them individually, considering fabric thickness, pattern, and the current seams and joints the shirt has.

Once they have assessed the shirt, they inverse it, lay it out, and mark the shirt using a 3D printed template which takes your measurements and adds the correct % of wiggle room across the chest, waist, hips, and biceps.

This is where our tailors make accommodations for irregularities such as a thinner fabric, specific seams, or joints.

After making the shirt, the same tailor will pick the seams, disconnect the cuff, and cut the shirt to size, insuring that both sides mirror each other(a common problem with off the rack clothing).

Using a serger stitch, we make our first pass, giving a clean durable seam on the inside. We match the threads to the existing thread colors, and take a second pass with a tight weave straight stitch for a durable finished edge.

We wrap up  the sewing by reattaching at the cuff and hemming the bottom joint to a finished edge.

To complete the process we iron the shirt, fold it carefully before wrapping it up, packaging, and shipping it back to you.
